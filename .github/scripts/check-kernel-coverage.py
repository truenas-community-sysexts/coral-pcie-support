"""Decide whether an existing release already covers a kernel.

Called by check-releases.yml when a new TrueNAS stable version appears.
Reads the repo's releases on stdin (gh api --paginate: one JSON array per
page, concatenated) and reports what covers the kernel in $NEW_KERNEL for
the driver in $CURRENT_DRIVER:

    promoted <tag>   served by install.sh's stable channel: no build needed,
                     the tracked version may advance.
    pending <tag>    unpromoted stable build awaiting hardware test: no
                     duplicate build, but the tracked version must NOT
                     advance (that consumes the one-shot version-changed
                     event, so deleting the build after a failed hardware
                     test would leave the kernel with no rebuild path).
    (nothing)        no coverage: build.

Preview (BETA/RC) builds never count: they never promote, so the stable
channel never serves them. A k-tag whose body lost the Target kernel row
counts only once promoted: unpromoted, it cannot be told apart from a
preview build, and the safe default is to build.

Matching rules mirror install.sh's release-selection snippet;
tests/test_kernel_coverage.py holds both to the shared fixtures.
